This project is an attempt at a multiplayer roguelike set on a partially
terraformed planet somewhere out in space in the future. It has a slight
cyberpunk-like feel (due to the use of "decks", "chips", and "code fragments")
with some other modifications wherever it was felt it needed to change.

Platforms targeted for the client are Windows and Linux, while the server is
Linux only.

## Goals

  1. Equip yourself with weapons and armor.
  2. Dive into the mines nearby the colony.
  3. ???
  4. Profit!

Storyline TBD.

## Software Requirements
Currently the netcrack codebase is slowly evolving, but has some minimal
requirements:

  * The Doryen Library (aka libtcod)
  * SLang

## Why another roguelike?
Why not? The idea was hacked together during Thanksgiving of '08 while a pair of
siblings were looking for something to do together. They tried mAngband, ToME,
and others looking for a simple, easy to play roguelike that was multiplayer.
Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned roguelikes were up to the task, so
they decided to hack their own way. Netcrack is their result.
